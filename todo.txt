Notice that every move beats two moves:

The move previous to it in the cycle (or four cases ahead)
The move two cases ahead in the cycle
So let d = (5 + a - b) % 5. Then:

d = 1 or d = 3 => a wins
d = 2 or d = 4 => b wins
d = 0 => tie
For the Rock-Paper-Scissor version:

let d = (3 + a - b) % 3. Then:

d = 1 => a wins
d = 2 => b wins
d = 0 => tie
Generalization For n >= 3 and n odd:

Let d = (n + a - b) % n. Then:

If d = 0 => tie
If d % 2 = 1 => a wins
If d % 2 = 0 => b wins
